          <i>Hi, I’m Akalya!</i>
        </b>{" "}
        I started my creative journey with a love for
        <b> logo design</b>—exploring how shapes, colors, and fonts can bring a
        brand to life. I enjoyed helping businesses express who they are through
        simple, eye-catching visuals. Over time, I got curious about how design
        works on the web, which led me to <b>front-end development</b>. Learning{" "}
        <b>HTML, CSS,JavaScript,</b> and <b>Reactjs</b> allowed me to turn
        designs into real, interactive websites.

      <p className="text-justify">
        I love combining design with code to create smooth, user-friendly
        digital experiences. My background in design helps me pay close
        attention to detail in my coding work. Whether I’m creating a logo or
        building a website, my goal is always to solve problems in a clear and
        creative way. Today, I’m passionate about <b> making beautiful</b> and
        <b> functional digital solutions</b>. I’m always learning and exploring
        new ways to improve user experiences with thoughtful design and clean
        code. Let’s work together to bring ideas to life—where{" "}
        <b>design meets development!</b>
